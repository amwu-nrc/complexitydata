#' Atlas of Economic Complexity and Australian State export data
#'
#' @details
#'
#' Atlas of Economic complexity data with Australia removed and replaced by
#' Australian State export data. State export data has been converted from the AHECC
#' system to the Harmonised System (1992 version)
#'
#' Economic complexity indicators provided by the Atlas of Economic Complexity will not align with the indicators included in this dataset.
#' This is due in part to the inclusion of the state export data and exclusion of Australia. However, export data provided by the Atlas of Economic
#' Complexity dataverse undergoes additional pre-processing before the indicators are calculated (see: \url{https://github.com/cid-harvard/py-ecomplexity/issues/21})
